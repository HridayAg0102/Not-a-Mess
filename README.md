# Not-a-Mess 🍱
Students face a lot of problems regarding mess food. We aim to make an app where students can report issues as well as rate mess food on a daily basis. The app can be used by the mess manager to know the amount of food to be prepared on a particular day, take a look into the dashboard where analysis and statistics of all the issues and complaints would be available.
